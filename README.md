## General info
Peace.io is a game that encourages players to take a break from the issues in the real world.
Other than using the tumbleweed you are controlling to toss stones into the vacuum, it has no special objective.
The game also includes a time of day feature that lets you play in environments that look different at midday, sunset, and in the middle of the night.
